            Following in the traditions and values that the founding fathers of Delta Chi intended, Alberta Chapter of the Delta Chi fraternity, although young, has been an exemplary example of balancing academic, social and individual development. Part of a network of 135 chapters across the United States and Canada, Alberta Chapter is furthest north position in Delta Chi to date. Colonized on April 1st 1995, Alberta Chapter has earned the respect of the University community through its active participation and organization of philanthropy events, positions in leadership organizations, academic diligence and athletic participation. Members within the fraternity are held to a high moral standard which is codified within the regulations of the fraternity, referred to as the Eleven Basic Expectations. Focusing on nurturing a balanced healthy lifestyle for its members, Alberta Chapter remains as an exemplar of Greek life on campus.

          The Founding of the Delta Chi Fraternity
        </h2>
        <div className="mt-6 space-y-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          <p>
            Since at least 1929, Delta Chi has recognized the following eleven men as the <strong>Founders</strong> of
            The Delta Chi Fraternity: Albert Sullard Barnes, Myron McKee Crandall, John Milton
            Gorham, Peter Schermerhorn Johnson, Edward Richard O&apos;Malley, Owen Lincoln
            Potter, Alphonse Derwin Stillman, Thomas A. J. Sullivan, Monroe Marsh
            Sweetland, Thomas David Watkins, Frederick Moore Whitney.
          </p>
          <p>
            This list has not always been the accepted one. Even those on the list had differing opinions
            as to who deserved such recognition. To more fully understand the confusion, let us go back
            to the school year of 1889-90 and &quot;set the stage&quot; for the inception of the second law
            fraternity at Cornell. The school year of 1889-90 began with conversations of starting a new
            law fraternity, but, as school work increased, the idea was put off until the spring semester.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two incidents have been credited with providing the impetus for renewed interest in the
            founding of what was to become Delta Chi. One was the election of a Phi Delta Phi as the
            Law School Editor of the <em>Cornell Daily Sun</em> (the student newspaper) and the second was
            the election of the law school junior class president. In the case of the class presidency,
            Alphonse Derwin Stillman had done some campaigning for a student named Irving G.
            Hubbard and was unaware of any effort being made in anyone else&apos;s behalf. When the
            voting results were in, Charles Frenkel, a Phi Delta Phi, was declared the winner. That
            caused Stillman to start &quot;asking around.&quot; It appears that what he found was a law school
            which was dominated by one small, closely knit group — Phi Delta Phi.
          </p>
          <p>
            The question of who first conceived the idea of a new fraternity will probably never be
            answered. According to Frederick Moore Whitney there were probably two or three groups
            working on the idea that spring.
          </p>
          <p>
            Monroe Marsh Sweetland (who was also a member of Delta Tau Delta from Cornell)
            claimed the idea was his alone; Myron McKee Crandall claimed the fraternity was started in
            his and Frank Edward Thomas&apos; apartment at 126 E. Seneca Street; Stillman remembered
            being approached by &quot;one of the boys&quot; after the class election but couldn&apos;t remember who.
            In any case, there were meetings held in Crandall&apos;s apartment as well as in Sweetland&apos;s law
            office on the second floor of the Wilgus Block at the southwest corner of State and Tioga
            street. It is not clear how these two groups came together, or even in which month, though
            there seems to have been some individuals who had attended both groups. Crandall did
            remember approaching Sweetland about the concept of the new fraternity and how excited
            he was, and how he had joined right in. Sweetland said he always had considered the
            founding of Delta Chi to date back to when he had unfolded the whole idea to Crandall.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the class officer elections and the Law School Editorship incidents may have provided
            the initial incentives for organization, it soon became clear that those involved were looking
            for much more. Realizing a common desire for fellowship and intellectual association, they
            sought to enrich their college experiences by creating among themselves a common bond;
            a bond that would materially assist each in the acquisition of a sound education; a bond that
            would provide each enduring value. As with any important commitment, there must be time
            for contemplation and planning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the summer, many of the details of the organization were worked out by Crandall, who
            had stayed in Ithaca until after school opened. There was additional work accomplished by
            Sweetland, John Milton Gorham and Stillman.
          </p>
          <p>
            In regards to the adoption of the constitution, Albert Sullard Barnes wrote the following in his
            1907 Quarterly article:
          </p>
          <blockquote className="ml-4 border-l-4 border-delta-red pl-4 italic text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
            &quot;As I recall it, after refreshing my recollection from the original minutes now in my
            possession, on the evening of October 13, 1890, six students in the Law School,
            brothers John M. Gorham, Thomas J. Sullivan, F. K. Stephens, A.D. Stillman and the
            writer, together with Myron Crandall and O. L. Potter, graduate students, and Monroe
            Sweetland, a former student in the Law School, met in a brother&apos;s room and adopted
            the constitution and by-laws, and organized the Delta Chi Fraternity.&quot;
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            The minutes from that meeting state &quot;Charter granted to Cornell Chapter&quot; (Note: While it is
            only supposition, it is believed that the Founders chose to name their chapter and,
            therefore, all chapters to follow, after the school in which they had so much pride in hopes
            that some of the prestige of the school would &quot;rub off&quot; on their fraternity. The naming of
            chapters varies from fraternity to fraternity with school names, Greek alphabet, Greek
            alphabet within state and Greek alphabet and numbers being the most common.) indicating
            from the beginning the intent to start a national fraternity. From the spring semester of 1890
            until October 13, 1890, there existed, in effect, a fraternity which had no chapters.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the fall of 1890 the names of Fred Kingsbury Stephens, Martin Joseph Flannery and
            Frank Edward Thomas appeared on the agreement to share the cost of purchasing a
            sample badge for the fraternity, and the signatures of both Flannery and Stephens
            appeared on the pledge &quot;… to form a Greek letter fraternity….&quot; Since both Flannery and
            Stephens dropped out of the organization early, they have not been included as Founders.
            The inclusion of Thomas&apos; name as a Founder has been hotly debated since the beginning,
            and Carl Peterson, Union &apos;22, who had researched the founding of Delta Chi during the 20s
            and was largely responsible for the recognition of Crandall as a Founder, maintained that
            Thomas was equally deserving. This was confirmed in conversations with Barnes, Crandall
            and Thomas, but met with opposition from some of the remaining Founders. The prime
            reason for denying his recognition seems to be the fact that the did not return to Ithaca in
            the fall of 1890, even though he was actively involved in the inception of the fraternity during
            the 1889-90 school year when it, at least on an informal basis, actually came into existence.
            The possible role he played in the birth of Delta Chi is re-counted in Peterson&apos;s article &quot;New
            Version of Our Founding,&quot; in the September 1930 Quarterly. The authenticity of this role
            was strongly supported by Crandall. It is interesting to note that Crandall also did not return
            to school in the fall of 1890, although he did work in Ithaca until early in the fall semester
            when he left for Utica, N.Y. and Sweetland, having graduated the previous spring, was
            practicing law in Ithaca. Despite this, Crandall was listed as an active charter member of the
            Cornell Chapter on October 13, 1890. It was at his insistence, with it is assumed, the
            support of the majority of the members present, that Frank Thomas was listed as an
            honorary member. Sweetland was listed as an honorary charter member. Several of the
            Founders were working on their masters of Law degrees when the Fraternity was being
            organized.
          </p>
          <p>
            Up until the publishing of the 1929 Directory the list of our Founders did not include the
            name of Crandall. The inclusion of his name at that time was largely due to a replica of the
            original historical work of Peterson, even though as early as August 14, 1924, Crandall&apos;s
            name was recommended by Whitney for such recognition.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the same letter, Whitney recommended that Peter Schermerhorn Johnson not be
            recognized as a Founder since he wasn&apos;t initiated until December 1890 or March 1891.
            Johnson was, however, responsible for a large portion of the secrets of the Fraternity,
            writing &quot;Foven&apos;s Mater&quot; and drawing the first emblem for Delta Chi.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is interesting to note that, in 1910, Whitney sent to the Cornell Chapter a composite of the
            nine men who he then believed to be the Founders of Delta Chi with an enlarged picture of
            Sweetland in its center. He later had that composite removed when he determined that he
            had left out one or two men.

          EXPANSION
        </h2>
        <div className="mt-6 space-y-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          <p>
            On October 13,1890, &quot;Founders Crandall, Potter, and Sweetland were placed on the
            Supreme Council and authorized to proceed with expansion plans.&quot; At that same meeting,
            Barnes was appointed to work &quot;Buffalo Law School&quot; for possible expansion due to his
            association with a student there. The lack of enrollment at the school and the fact that the
            Phi Delta Phi Chapter there was doing poorly, delayed expansion to that school until later.
            Building Delta Chi into a true national fraternity began during the spring of 1891.
          </p>
          <p>
            On April 14, 1891, John Francis Tucker, of New York University, went to Ithaca and earned
            the confidence and regard of the Cornell Chapter. He was initiated into Delta Chi that night
            and was sent back to prepare his associates for induction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Stillman remembers Tucker (who was a member of Delta Upsilon) coming to find
            out about Delta Chi, Wilkinson tells the story with more confidence:
          </p>
          <blockquote className="ml-4 border-l-4 border-delta-red pl-4 italic text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
            &quot;At first the chapter and the fraternity were the same thing, and there were not
            separate officers. But in the spring of 1891, in the month of May, I think, we received
            a visit from John Francis Tucker of New York. We put up a big bluff, and treated him
            with great formality and instructed him to return to the place whence he came, and
            make formal application in writing for a charter from our ancient and honorable body.
            As soon as he departed, there was a hurry call for a meeting to organize a body to
            which he could apply and it was then that the first general officers of the fraternity, as
            distinct from the chapter, were elected. I cannot remember for the life of me who they
            were, except that I was Treasurer.&quot;
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Wilkinson&apos;s contention that the general fraternity wasn&apos;t formed until later seems, at least in
            part, to be verified by the minutes of the April 15, and May 23, 1891, meetings. At the April
            15, 1891 meeting, the constitution and ritual were adopted as read, the committee on
            charters was appointed, and the men traditionally considered the first set of officers (&quot;AA&quot;
            Owen Lincoln Potter, &quot;BB&quot; John Milton Gorham, &quot;CC&quot; George A. Nall, and &quot;DD&quot; Albert T.
            Wilkinson) were elected. It is interesting to note, in light of Wilkinson&apos;s statement about &quot;a
            hurry call for a meeting to organize a body to which he (Tucker) could apply&quot; is the fact that
            this April 15 meeting occurred the night after Tucker&apos;s initiation. At that May 23 meeting, the
            motto, grip, challenge, and the colors were adopted by the fraternity.
          </p>
          <p>
            One solution to the confusion is the possibility that Delta Chi was originally founded as a
            national fraternity, but with the pressures of school work and the chapter at Cornell to keep
            them busy, the Founders allowed the national organization to take a back seat. When
            Tucker appeared the next spring, the national organization had to be reorganized in order to
            accommodate the applicant from N.Y.U.
          </p>
          <p>
            As it turned out, Tucker played a significant role in the development of the Fraternity. In a
            letter to Johnson dated February 22, 1892, he stated:
          </p>
          <blockquote className="ml-4 border-l-4 border-delta-red pl-4 italic text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
            &quot;As to Dickinson Law School, I have been at work at that school since last August
            and I think I now have six more pledges, I have worked up a chapter of 25 men at the
            Albany Law School and another 12 men at the University of Minnesota.&quot;
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            The debt which Delta Chi owes Tucker would appear to be larger than previously
            recognized. In 1892 four more chapters were established, three of which exist today (the
            fourth — Albany Law School — had its charter transferred in 1901 to Union College; the
            Union Chapter existed until 1994). Twelve chapters were founded within the first decade
            and on February 13, 1897, Delta Chi became an international fraternity with the installation
            of the Osgoode Hall Chapter in Toronto, Canada. Delta Chi&apos;s first convention was held in
            1894 at the Michigan Chapter. By the turn of the century, Delta Chi had grown to ten
            chapters. The initial years of the new century saw conservative growth and the 1902
            Convention (where the White Carnation was selected as the fraternity&apos;s flower) authorized
            the Delta Chi Quarterly. The convention had misgivings. Everybody wanted it, some thought
            it was an unwarranted risk; no one had the slightest idea how to go about it. Harold White,
            Chicago-Kent &apos;01 became the first editor and Edward Nettles, Chicago-Kent &apos;00 was the first
            business manager. In an article in the May 1929 Quarterly, White had this to say:
          </p>
          <blockquote className="ml-4 border-l-4 border-delta-red pl-4 italic text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
            &quot;No doubt in our innocence, we felt the honor compensated for all the work. That&apos;s
            the marvel of being young and enthusiastic. There was no plan, no adequate
            appropriation for necessary expenses, no business or editorial policy …. There was
            not even a list of alumni members. We had to start from a point below zero and from
            the beginning the jobs of editor and business manager so interwove and over-lapped
            that it was difficult to say who did what. When it came to all the endless worries and
            sleepless nights that accompany the launching of a frail bark in unknown waters by
            two inexperienced mariners it was a joint enterprise and the punishment was inflicted
            equally.&quot;
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            April, 1903 saw the first issue of the Delta Chi Quarterly published for a fraternity of fourteen
            chapters and fewer than 3,000 alumni.
          </p>
          <p>
            On February 13, 1897, Delta Chi became an international fraternity.

          <p>
            In 1923 the old &quot;XX&quot; was abolished and replaced with an Executive Committee of seven.
            This board, comprised of the &quot;AA&quot;, &quot;CC&quot;, &quot;DD&quot;, &quot;EE&quot;, and three members-at-large, was the
            governing body of the fraternity between conventions. A new &quot;XX&quot; was created as an
            advisory body to the Executive Committee; its membership consisted of the &quot;BB&quot;s elected
            by each chapter.
          </p>
          <p>
            25th International Convention. August 27-30, 1929 Stanley Hotel, Estes Park, Colorado.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were other internal improvements during the period between the World Wars. The
            position of Executive Secretary was created in 1923 and provision made for a permanent
            central office which was finally established in 1929. The position of Director of Scholarship
            came into being in 1925 to lead the drive for general scholastic excellence. In 1927, one
            full-time Field Secretary was placed in direct contact with the chapters and, in 1935 a
            second one was added to the staff. By 1930, Delta Chi had grown to 36 chapters and, in
            1934, the Headquarters began publishing the Quarterly.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this era Delta Chi made two noteworthy contributions to the Greek letter fraternity
            world. The first of these was the Tutorial Advisor Plan–members of the faculty (preferably
            not members of the Fraternity) living in the house where they acted as tutors, advisors, and
            counselors.
          </p>
          <p>
            In yet another way Delta Chi took the lead among Greek letter organizations. At the 1929,
            Estes Park Convention, Delta Chi unanimously voted to abolish &quot;Hell Week.&quot; (The following
            day another national organization, meeting in convention, also abolished hazing.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The position of &quot;EE&quot; was also abolished at the 1929 convention and, at the 1935
            convention, the Executive Board was increased to nine. Without realizing the full
            significance of what it was starting, the Pennsylvania State Chapter in 1937 invited six
            chapters in neighboring states to meet with them. Dean C. M. Thompson, who was then the
            &quot;AA&quot;, saw the great potential of such gatherings and promptly asked the Indiana Chapter to
            be host for the first Midwest Regional Conference. After that the Regional Conference plan
            blossomed. But with World War II and the temporary suspension of many chapter
            operations, much about the mechanics of the Regional Conferences was forgotten. But the
            need, desire, and concept were not forgotten. After the war, Delta Chi saw its conference
            program expand and become more purposeful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today the Regional Conferences play an important role in the affairs of the fraternity. The
            conferences are the vehicle for the election of each Regent for a two-year term. More
            important, each conference is designed to accomplish specific purposes, including the
            development of new approaches to the solution of Fraternity problems; fostering a better
            understanding of the operation of the various programs of the general Fraternity and the
            Headquarters; promoting good will in university-fraternity relations; and bringing together
            large numbers of Delta Chis for information, inspiration, and plain good fun.

          <p>
            After the Great Depression and on the verge of the United States entering World War II, the
            Fraternity celebrated its 50th Anniversary with 35 chapters. Once again our young men
            went off to war and many of the chapter houses were taken over by the military as was
            done during the first world war. It was the alumni dues program, started in 1935, that
            provided the main source of revenue to the Fraternity while the chapters were not in
            operation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The war ended and the chapters resumed normal operations. By 1950, Delta Chi had 39
            chapters. 1951 saw the retirement of O.K. Patton from the position of Executive Secretary
            which, while he was a professor of Law at Iowa, he had held part-time since 1929 on an
            official basis. Prior to that time he had effectively operated the central office since his
            election as &quot;CC&quot;.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to 1929, the membership records of the fraternity would follow the election of the &quot;CC&quot;
            and the financial records would follow the election of the &quot;dd&quot;. When O. K. Patton was
            elected &quot;CC&quot; in 1923 he put the records in one room of a downtown Iowa City building and
            hired one part-time secretary. After the &quot;general&quot; membership question was resolved, Delta
            Chi grew from 21 to 36 chapters in four 1929 and the records and related activities had
            expanded to four rooms and four secretaries. Effectively after the fact, Delta Chi established
            its Headquarters in Iowa City where it has stayed.

          MODERN DEVELOPMENTS
        </h2>
        <div className="mt-6 space-y-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          <p>
            In 1958, the size of the Executive Board was increased to include the &quot;AA&quot;, &quot;CC&quot;, &quot;DD&quot;, the
            immediate past &quot;AA&quot;, and Regional Representatives called Regents. More important than
            the increased size was the method to be employed in selecting its members. As before, the
            &quot;AA&quot;, &quot;CC&quot;, and &quot;DD&quot; were chosen by the Convention. Included in the change was the
            adoption of a plan whereby regions were established and a Board member selected from
            each region. Prior to the adoption of this plan, every member of the Board could possibly
            have come from the same community or geographical area. The new plan made this
            impossible; the entire Board benefits from the geographical diversity.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1960, the Fraternity employed its first, full-time executive, Harold &quot;Buc&quot; Buchanan,
            Wisconsin &apos;35. Up to this time the Fraternity was run by volunteers or part-time employees.
            At the 1960 Convention, a &quot;Building Loan Fund&quot; was created. The original level of
            assessment proved too low and, in 1962, the Delta Chi Housing Fund was established to
            assume the function of the &quot;Building Loan Fund.&quot; Today, the Housing Fund has loans
            outstanding to chapters and colonies across the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also at the 1962 Convention, the Regional Representatives were redesignated as Regents
            and the Executive Board was renamed the Board of Regents.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1969, the Fraternity moved out of rented space into its first permanent facility. The
            property is wholly owned by Delta Chi and houses the archives of the Fraternity and a staff
            of three directors, five traveling consultants and three clerical employees.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the 1975 Chicago Convention, the Order of the White Carnation was created to honor
            alumni who give outstanding service to the Fraternity in a meritorious but inconspicuous
            way. The first inductee into the Order was Victor T. Johnson, Purdue &apos;32. In 1983, Senator
            Henry &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson, Washington &apos;34 was selected as the first Delta Chi of the Year in
            honor of his achievements in his chosen profession.
          </p>
          <p>
            While there have been a variety of changes that have strengthened Delta Chi within the last
            decade, the 80s will most probably be remembered for the growth in chapters. Starting with
            78 chapters and colonies in 1980, the Fraternity celebrated at its Centennial Convention
            with 120 chapters and colonies on the rolls.
          </p>
          <p>
            The year 2015 marked Delta Chi&apos;s 125th Anniversary. The Fraternity celebrated throughout
            the year, culminating with 125th Anniversary black-tie banquet (held October 10th) in
            Atlanta, Georgia, with nearly 200 Brothers and guests in attendance.
