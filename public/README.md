# Static assets

Files in `public` are served from the site root.

- **`/images/`** – Put images here (logos, photos, OG image, etc.).

**Usage in code:**

- **HTML/img:** `src="/images/logo.png"`
- **Next.js `<Image>`:** `src="/images/logo.png"` (or import from here if you prefer)

Example: `public/images/logo.png` → use as `/images/logo.png`.
